  abstract = {The precise time-evolution of quantum systems is a cornerstone of computational physics. This paper investigates the numerical stability of high-order Runge-Kutta (RK) methods when applied to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. We derive rigorous stability boundaries for symplectic and non-symplectic RK integrators and demonstrate that specific implicit schemes preserve unitarity over extended simulation times. By analyzing the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian operator, we establish a relationship between the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition and the imaginary eigenvalues characteristic of quantum propagators. Our findings are validated through simulations of wave packet scattering and harmonic oscillator dynamics, showing that our proposed optimized RK coefficients significantly reduce phase error accumulation compared to standard integrators.},

  abstract = {We present a novel constructive proof for the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) specifically within the context of function fields over finite constants. Unlike previous existential approaches, our method utilizes the spectral interpretation of the Frobenius automorphism acting on étale cohomology groups. We explicitly construct the L-functions associated with algebraic curves and demonstrate that their zeros lie strictly on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2. This work bridges the gap between classical analytic number theory and geometric invariant theory, offering new insights into the distribution of prime polynomials. The constructive nature of our proof allows for the algorithmic verification of L-function properties for curves of genus g > 100, which was previously computationally intractable.},

  abstract = {The behavior of spin systems on curved geometries offers a unique window into the interplay between topology and statistical mechanics. This study employs extensive Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase transitions of the 2D Ising model mapped onto hyperbolic lattices (Poincaré disk). We utilize the Wolff cluster algorithm to overcome critical slowing down near the phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that the critical exponents on negatively curved surfaces deviate significantly from the standard Onsager solution for flat Euclidean lattices. Specifically, we observe a suppression of the correlation length divergence, suggesting a mean-field-like behavior induced by the exponential expansion of the lattice volume. These findings have implications for understanding quantum gravity models and holographic duality.},

  abstract={We establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions for a class of non-linear Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs) driven by multiplicative Lévy noise. The equations under consideration model turbulent fluid flow and heat transport in random media. By employing a Galerkin approximation scheme combined with a compact embedding theorem, we prove the convergence of the approximate solutions in appropriate Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, we derive a priori estimates that ensure the global regularity of the solution almost surely. A key contribution of this work is the treatment of non-Lipschitz coefficients using a stochastic Gronwall inequality, extending the applicability of the theory to more singular physical models. We also discuss the ergodic properties of the invariant measures associated with the SPDEs.},

  abstract = {Simulating the dynamics of many-body localized (MBL) systems poses a significant challenge due to the logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy. This paper analyzes the algorithmic complexity of contracting Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), when applied to MBL Hamiltonians. We prove that while the exact contraction is #P-complete, approximate contraction schemes based on singular value decomposition (SVD) truncation exhibit polynomial time complexity with bounded error for short-time evolution. However, we identify a "complexity phase transition" at the ergodic-MBL transition point, where the bond dimension required for a fixed accuracy diverges exponentially. We propose a novel adaptive bond-dimension algorithm that optimizes computational resources by exploiting the area law of entanglement in the localized phase, demonstrating superior performance on Heisenberg spin chains.},
