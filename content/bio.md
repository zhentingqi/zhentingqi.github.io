Welcome! I am a 1st year Computer Science Ph.D. student at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), where I am honored to be co-advised by Prof. [Yilun Du](https://yilundu.github.io/) and Prof. [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). 

My research centers around developing intelligent and reliable AI systems that benefit human society. Motivated by this, I am generally interested in the following topics (w/o particular order):

- **Reasoning**
    - Understanding and enhancing reasoning capabilities in foundation models
    - Developing AI systems that generalize effectively to OOD scenarios
    - Training (multi-)agents for compositional reasoning tasks

- **Reliability**
    - Improving understanding of foundation models and AI systems
    - Enhancing controllability and robustness
    - Designing scalable computational methods for reliability while advancing capabilities

I've had the privilege of working closely with many distinguished researchers, including (the late) Prof. [Dragomir R. Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/) at Yale, Prof. [Volodymyr Kindratenko](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/kindrtnk) at UIUC, Dr. [Li Lyna Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lzhani/) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), Prof. [Eric Xing](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/professor-eric-xing/) at CMU, and Prof. [James Glass](https://sls.csail.mit.edu/people/glass.shtml) at MIT.
