Hi there! I am an incoming CS PhD student at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Yilun Du](https://yilundu.github.io/) and Prof. [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). My research interest lies broadly in `Foundation Models` and `Generative AI`. My long-term research goal is to build intelligent and reliable AI systems for the benefit of human society. Motivated by this goal, I am generally interested in the following topics (w/o particular order)

1) `Reasoning`: How do current ML models perform reasoning and how do we improve them? How do we train AI systems to perform robust reasoning that generalizes well to out-of-distribution scenarios?

2) `Reliability`: How do we better understand AI systems and further enhance their controllability and robustness? How can we design scalable method to ensure their safety while we are improving their capabilities?

My most recent research focused on 1) training language agents for complex reasoning tasks like coding assistance and scientific discovery, 2) memory mechanisms for language agents, 3) training-time/test-time self-evolution of ML models, and 4) designing dynamic evaluation benchmarks for reasoning/generalization capabilities of ML models.

Our research group is open to collaborations! Please feel free to reach out at `zhentingqi [at] g [dot] harvard [dot] edu`.

Previously, I received master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering from Harvard, and dual bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from both [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) and [ZJU](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) with highest honors. I was fortunate to work with (the late) Prof. [Dragomir R. Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/) at Yale, Prof. [Volodymyr Kindratenko](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/kindrtnk) at UIUC, Dr. [Li Lyna Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lzhani/) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), and Prof. [James Glass](https://sls.csail.mit.edu/people/glass.shtml) at MIT.
