Hi there! I am an incoming CS PhD student at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I am fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Yilun Du](https://yilundu.github.io/) and Prof. [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). Previously, I received master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering from Harvard, and dual bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from both [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) and [ZJU](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) with highest honors.

Previously, I was a student researcher at Yale advised by (the late) Prof. [Dragomir R. Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/), and at UIUC advised by Prof. [Volodymyr Kindratenko](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/kindrtnk). I also interned at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), advised by Dr. [Li Lyna Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lzhani/). I also worked closely with Prof. [James Glass](https://sls.csail.mit.edu/people/glass.shtml) at MIT.

Our research group is open to collaborations! Please feel free to reach out at zhentingqi[AT]g[DOT]harvard[DOT]edu.
