Welcome! I am an incoming Computer Science Ph.D. student at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/), where I am honored to be co-advised by Prof. [Yilun Du](https://yilundu.github.io/) and Prof. [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/). My research focuses on advancing `Foundation Models` and `Generative AI`, with the ultimate vision of developing intelligent and reliable AI systems that benefit human society. Motivated by this, I am generally interested in the following topics (w/o particular order):

- **Reasoning**
  - Understanding and enhancing reasoning capabilities in foundation models
  - Developing robust AI systems that generalize effectively to OOD scenarios
  - Training agents for compositional reasoning tasks

- **Reliability**
  - Improving our understanding of AI systems
  - Enhancing AI controllability and robustness
  - Designing scalable methods to ensure reliability while advancing capabilities

More specifically, I am currently investigating several exciting directions:

- ðŸ¤– Training language agents for coding assistance and scientific discovery
- ðŸ§  Developing advanced memory mechanisms for language agents
- ðŸ”„ Exploring training-time and test-time self-evolution
- ðŸ“Š Creating dynamic evaluation benchmarks for reasoning and generalization

Our research group actively welcomes collaborations! Feel free to reach out at:

## About Me

I hold a master's degree in Computational Science and Engineering from Harvard, and dual bachelor's degrees in Computer Engineering from [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) and [ZJU](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) (highest honors).

I've had the privilege of working closely with many distinguished researchers, including (the late) Prof. [Dragomir R. Radev](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/radev/) at Yale, Prof. [Volodymyr Kindratenko](https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/kindrtnk) at UIUC, Dr. [Li Lyna Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lzhani/) at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), andProf. [James Glass](https://sls.csail.mit.edu/people/glass.shtml) at MIT
